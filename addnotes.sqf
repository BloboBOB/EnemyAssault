	SL, JTAC and UAV Operators can call for support from the 0-8 Menu. AH-99 and A-164 Air support will loiter around until fuel is low or out of ammo or 30 minutes on station then RTB for resupply. This will take at least 30 minutes. UAV support starts at base and will fly from base towards the position on map where you selected so take control of it sometime after you call it in and give it some kind of waypoint or you might lose the UAV. UGV parachutes in and moves to position selected on map. AR-2 Darter can be called by the Team Leaders and UAV Operators. AR-2 Darter, UAV and UGV will automatically connect to you if you have the uav terminal when they are called in. Only the Squad Leader can call in an Ammo Crate air drop.

	All vehicles will respawn after 5 minutes if they can no longer move and no one is inside or they are destroyed. Alive vehicles require players to be beyond 300 meters in order for them to respawn. You can spawn ground vehicles, aircraft and boats at the signs marked on map. Vehicles spawned by the player do not respawn and are tracked locally. You can only have 2 vehicles at any one time. If you have vehicles that are not alive or cannot move then they will be deleted once you open the Spawn Vehicle dialog. Vehicles have cargo capacity and can load up other vehicles or ammo crates depending on the size. If a vehicle is on a spawn pad area and no one is inside it will be deleted no matter who spawned it. If you beach a boat you can push it off via the action menu.
